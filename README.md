Basic Javascript program which simulates L치szl칩 Kalm치r's and D치niel Muszka's robot ladybug.
How to use:
The ladybug can be controlled with the arrow and "w" "a" "s" "d" keys.
The map randomly generates several obstacles, which the ladybug can bump into.
When they collide, the ladybug resents this, and cannot move until the user clicks on their back (pat the ladybug).
There is a flashlight, that can be turned on and off with the "f" key, rotated with "q" and "e" keys, and moved via mouse drag-and-drop.
To be continued:
the ladybug is supposed to follow the light of the flashlight, and a sound-learning function is to be added.
